<br>
You're given a string consisting of words separated by spaces. Your task is to sort each word based on its letters but with a twist. The order of letters is not standard alphabetic order but a predefined one.

Here is the new priority order of the letters:  ```QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJKLZXCVBNM```

For instance, consider the word *PROGRAM*. The sorted word based on the new order will be *PGROARM*.


#### Input
A single line string consisting of words separated by spaces. The string will have at most 100 words, and each word will be between 1 and 10 letters long.

#### Output
A single line string where each word from the input has its letters sorted based on the new order.
